The construction process for these miniature structures is briefly shown, including woodworking and tiling. Later, the creator furnishes the \"MiaoDangLao's\" restaurant with tiny tables and chairs, and a miniature Tesla Cybertruck delivers more furniture. Inside the restaurant, a white cat, \"Tutu,\" plays the role of the owner, while \"Bucuo\" orders food.
